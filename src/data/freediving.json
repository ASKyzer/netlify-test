    "content": "Why freediving?” many ask. Why do you want to hold your breath until your body is screaming for air and see how far you can go, when you can strap a scuba tank on your back and go as far as you want? Well, freediving is not at all like this! It is not about your body screaming for air and not about suffering for lack of oxygen. Freedivers don’t come back from a dive looking like they are about to suffocate, but most of the time they break the surface with a big smile stamped on their face.\n\n\n\nWhy are they smiling? That is hard to explain to people who have never tried it! The feeling of gliding in the blue water, the feeling of being at peace submerged in this big vast liquid world, the feeling of becoming a sea creature, the feeling of belonging that makes us almost remember our real aquatic origins; all of this condensed in a 1 or 2 minutes experience, makes it very hard not to smile!."
