  "content": "Ocean Tigers Dive Hostel is not your average hostel. We are a dive hostel, a hostel that caters to divers and freedivers alike. Here we pride ourselves on providing that \"home sweet home\" feeling people love so much with a service centered around the love of the ocean. We are smaller than your average hostel but from the second you step into the door, we become your friends. I mean, we have a pool, netflix, ps4, an awesome staff, throw random bbq parties, or just chill in a hammock, and so much more.\n\n\n\nOcean Tigers Dive Hostel is also an escape from the tourism, city noise, and hustling. But, with that being said we are no more than a walking distance away from the party, beach, and restaurants. But don't take our words for it, come check us out if you are ever in the Cabo San Lucas area of Baja California!.\n\n\n\nOcean Tigers Dive House, a hostel for people that want to get into or already have an interest in diving or freediving in the Cabo San Lucas area of Baja California. The Dive Hostel was founded in 2015 by two friends, one French and the other Japanese. With their love of diving and travel, they launched the grand opening of the dive hostel on January 1st of 2016."
